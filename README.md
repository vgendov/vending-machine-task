# HELLO THERE!

# Getting Started

You will need to run `npm install` in the root directory, to make sure all the needed dependencies have been installed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Notes

For server mocking I have used MSW (Mock Server Worker - https://mswjs.io/)

In the end I would like to say that I had fun working on this task and to thank you for the given opportunity! =]
